                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello there! I'm Jakub, a highly motivated and self-driven individual with a passion for technology and a background in Computer Science. Currently working as a Barista Maestro at Costa while aspiring to make a leap into the dynamic world of software development. As of now I am currently really interested in building my own home-server to host proxmox where I plan to refine my skills in software development, networking, self-hosting, and even hardware. In my spare time I enjoy programming, you can view my public projects on my github. What do I program? It can vary from just implementing my own data structures and algorithms to fun little projects I think during that 3 am witching hour inspiration.</p>

                <h2>Professional Background</h2>
                <p>With a solid foundation in programming and a keen interest in both software and hardware, I have dedicated myself to continuous learning and self-improvement. My journey into the tech realm started with self-taught programming skills, and I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world projects. I graduated from Heriot Watt Univerisity in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with honours of the first class. My honours project and disseration for my final year being one of my biggest projects. Inspired by Open-Ended Evolution, I set out to evalutate the effectiveness of using a mish-mash of genetic algorithms, mutation, and propability as an optimiser for compilers. Through this project I've learned a lot about my self, such as my limits, but also my strengths.</p>
